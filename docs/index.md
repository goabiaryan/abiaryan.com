Hi, I‚Äôm Abi. I am the founder of  [Abide A.I.](https://abideai.com/), machine learning research engineer and an author. My books include LLMOps: Managing Large Language Models in Production, O'Reilly Publication (released: July 2025) and GPU Engineering for AI Systems, Packt Publication (releasing Autumn 2026).

My work focuses on building intelligent systems that scale. Over the past decade, I‚Äôve designed and deployed production-grade machine learning pipelines across domains like recommender systems, speech synthesis, time-series forecasting, and automated data labeling for both audio and video.

I‚Äôm especially interested in the challenges that emerge at scale: memory optimization, distributed training, GPU engineering, and the future of multi-agent systems. I‚Äôm  currently advancing research in:

- Reflective intelligence in AI agents
- Self-healing protocols in distributed multi-agent environments
- GPU systems for large-scale training of language models

Previously, I was a Visiting Research Scholar at UCLA‚Äôs Cognitive Systems Lab under [Dr. Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html), where I focused on intelligent agents with a focus on AutoML, Emotion Recognition, Causal Inference and Multi-Agent learning.

I‚Äôve also served as a reviewer for leading ML and NLP venues like NeurIPS, ACL, EMNLP, and AABI, and I care deeply about helping engineers understand the low-level systems knowledge needed to train and deploy advanced AI models reliably.
