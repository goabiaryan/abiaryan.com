Hi, my name is Abi. I am a computer scientist working extensively in machine learning to make the software systems smarter. Over the past seven years, my focus has been building machine learning models for various applications including recommendation systems, voice-tech, geo-positional apps etc. 

In the past, I also attended [Insight](https://insightfellows.com/data-science) as a Data Science Fellow and was a Visiting Research Scholar at UCLA under [Dr. Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html) where I worked in AutoML, MultiAgent Systems and Emotion Recognition.

‚úçÔ∏è I am also currently authoring **LLMOps: Managing Large Language Models in Production** book for O'Reilley Publications and an **MLOps: Deploying ML models in production** course with Educative for data scientists to learn fundamentals of data engineering and how to deploy machine learning models in production.

## Publications
[Arena: A General Evaluation Platform and Building Toolkit for Multi-Agent Intelligence](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6216), *Accepted for poster presentation at AAAI 2020*
