Hi, my name is Abi. I am a computer scientist and machine learning engineer working extensively in A.I. to make the software systems smarter. 

Over the past seven years, my focus has been building production-level machine learning systems for various applications including recommender systems, automated data labelling pipelines for both audio and video, audio-speech synthesis, forecasting and time-series analysis etc.

In the past, I attended [Insight](https://insightfellows.com/data-science) as a Data Science Fellow and was a Visiting Research Scholar at UCLA under [Dr. Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html) where I worked in AutoML, MultiAgent Systems and Emotion Recognition.

‚úçÔ∏è I am also currently authoring **LLMOps: Managing Large Language Models in Production** book for O'Reilley Publications and worked on an **MLOps: Deploying ML models in production** course for data scientists to learn fundamentals of machine learning software systems and how to deploy machine learning models in production.
